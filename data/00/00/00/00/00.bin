  |   The squid kids called Inklings are back to splat more ink and         |
  |   claim more turf in this colorful and chaotic 4-on-4 action shooter.   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   For the first time, take Turf War battles on-the-go with the          |
  |   Nintendo Switch system, and use any of the console's portable play    |
  |   styles for intense local multiplayer action.                          |
  |   Even team up for new 4-player co-op fun in Salmon Run!                |
  |   Two years have passed since the original Splatoon game was            |
  |   released and two years have also passed in Inkopolis! So expect a     |
  |   fresh wave of fashion, not to mention new weapons and gear.           |

  |   It's been a few months since the last Splatoon 2 update, but          |
  |   Nintendo readied a new patch tonight. Version 5.0.1 is out now        |
  |   for all players                                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Changes to Multiplayer                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed an issue causing players to mistakenly move forward while     |
  |     in mid-air during the first swing of an Ultra Stamp when pressing   |
  |     and holding ZR to swing the stamp repeatedly                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed an issue allowing players to jump further than intended       |
  |     when jumping at a specific time while using the Ultra Stamp         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * These changes fix the issue of players being able to enter areas    |
  |     of certain stages they should have been restricted from             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed an issue causing players with poor internet connections to    |
  |     not appear in the appropriate location on the screens of other      |
  |     players when using certain special weapons at a specific time       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed an issue in Starfish Mainstage allowing players to gain       |
  |     access to the opponent's base via a specific grate when jumping     |
  |     while pressing and holding ZR to ink continuously with the          |
  |     Inkbrush or Octobrush                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed an issue in Sturgeon Shipyard allowing players to gain        |
  |     access to the opponent's base via a specific grate when jumping     |
  |     while pressing and holding ZR to ink continuously with the          |
  |     Inkbrush or Octobrush                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed an issue in Shellendorf Institute causing players to clip     |
  |     into the stage terrain when moving near a certain wall              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed an issue in Shellendorf Institute occurring in Rainmaker      |
  |     mode allowing players to clip into a specific piece of stage        |
  |     terrain                                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fixed an issue in Camp Triggerfish that had previously allowed      |
  |     players to gain access to an Inkrail from an unintended direction   |
  |     by slightly adjusting the rail's position                           |
  |                                                                         |
